# Genese
GENESE is a React Native (Expo) app with a Node/Express + MongoDB backend that guides users through onboarding, RGPD consent, an auto-assessment (bilan), and a personalized training program (sessions + exercises). It adapts intensity using RPE/pain feedback and triggers safety alerts when thresholds are exceeded.
